# Quilt

A local-first, modular memory and context engine. Quilt watches your work, fragments your documents into meaningful pieces (swatches), embeds them into a searchable memory (the swatch book), and assembles contextual spreads in response to queries.

Use Quilt to power LLM tools with fast, structured, and evolving context—without relying on cloud infrastructure or leaking your knowledge.
