# Quilt Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Material System

### Step 1: Basic Material Types âœ…

- [x] Implement basic Material struct
  - Using `time` for timestamps
  - Using `cuid2` for IDs

- [x] Create MaterialFileType enum
  - Currently supporting Markdown files
  - Extensible for future file types
- [x] Write unit tests for basic types
  - Material creation tests
  - Status transition tests
  - CUID uniqueness tests
  - Timestamp ordering tests

### Step 2: Material Registry âœ…

- [x] Create MaterialRegistry struct
  - Implemented with HashMap storage
  - Added event emission system
- [x] Implement basic CRUD operations
  - register: Add new materials
  - get/get_by_path: Retrieve materials
  - update: Modify existing materials
  - remove: Delete materials
  - list_all: Get all materials
- [x] Add event system
  - StatusChanged events
  - Event subscription
  - Event emission on state changes
- [x] Write comprehensive tests
  - CRUD operation tests
  - Event emission tests
  - Error handling tests

## Current Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
# Core dependencies
cuid2 = "0.1.2"
time = { version = "0.3", features = ["serde", "macros"] }
event-emitter = "0.1.1"

# Future dependencies
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }  # For async support
notify = "6.0"  # For file watching
```

## Next Steps
