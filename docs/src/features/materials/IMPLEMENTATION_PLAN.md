- [ ] Add in-memory storage for materials
- [ ] Write tests for registry operations

### Step 3: Directory Scanner (2-3 days)

- [ ] Implement basic file system operations
- [ ] Create directory scanning functionality
- [ ] Filter for markdown files
- [ ] Add tests for directory scanning

### Step 4: Material Validation (2-3 days)

- [ ] Implement MaterialValidator trait
- [ ] Create basic markdown validation rules
- [ ] Add validation status tracking
- [ ] Write validation tests

### Step 5: Event System (2-3 days)

- [ ] Define MaterialEvent enum
- [ ] Implement basic event emission
- [ ] Create event subscribers
- [ ] Add event handling tests

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features

### Step 6: Error Handling (1-2 days)

- [ ] Implement custom error types
- [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Improve error reporting
- [ ] Write error handling tests

### Step 7: File Watching (2-3 days)

- [ ] Add file system watching
- [ ] Implement change detection
- [ ] Create update mechanisms
- [ ] Add file watching tests

### Step 8: Performance Optimization (2-3 days)

- [ ] Add async support
- [ ] Implement batch processing
- [ ] Optimize file operations
- [ ] Write performance tests

## Implementation Notes

### Starting Point

We'll begin with Step 1, implementing the core types exactly as shown in the architecture document. This gives us the foundation to build upon.

### Development Approach

1. Each step will follow Test-Driven Development (TDD)
2. We'll implement the simplest working version first
3. Each feature will be developed in isolation before integration
4. Documentation will be written alongside code

### Key Principles

- Keep it simple initially
- Focus on correctness before optimization
- Write clear, idiomatic Rust code
- Maintain good test coverage

### Dependencies

We'll add dependencies gradually as needed, starting with the minimum required for each step:

Step 1:

- uuid
- chrono

Later steps will add:

- tokio (for async)
- anyhow (for error handling)
- notify (for file watching)
- etc.

### First Implementation Task

To get started, we'll implement the basic Material struct and its associated enums. This will give us a foundation to build upon and help you get familiar with Rust syntax and concepts.
