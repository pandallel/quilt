  - Implemented with HashMap storage
  - Added event emission system
- [x] Implement basic CRUD operations
  - upsert: Add or update materials
  - get/get_by_path: Retrieve materials
  - remove: Delete materials
  - list_all: Get all materials
- [x] Add event system
  - StatusChanged events
  - Event subscription
  - Event emission on state changes
- [x] Write comprehensive tests
  - CRUD operation tests
  - Event emission tests
  - Error handling tests

### Step 3: Directory Scanner âœ…

  - [x] File existence checks
  - [x] Permission checks
- [x] Create directory scanning functionality
  - [x] Recursive directory traversal using WalkDir
  - [x] File filtering
  - [x] Error handling
- [x] Add configuration options
  - [x] Hidden file/directory handling
  - [x] Symlink following
- [x] Add tests for directory scanning
  - [x] Valid directory tests
  - [x] Invalid path tests
  - [x] Hidden file tests
  - [x] Duplicate file tests

## Current Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
# Core dependencies
cuid2 = "0.1.2"
time = { version = "0.3", features = ["serde", "macros"] }
event-emitter = "0.1.1"

# Future dependencies
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }  # For async support
notify = "6.0"  # For file watching
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement directory scanning

   - Basic file system operations
   - Error handling
   - Tests

2. Add validation system

   - MaterialValidator trait
   - Basic markdown validation
   - Validation tests

3. Begin async support
