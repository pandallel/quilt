# Material

A Material is any text or markdown file that Quilt can read and work with. These files are the starting point for everything Quilt does â€” they're where your content lives before it gets broken down and analyzed.

## Overview

Materials are the foundation of Quilt's memory system. When you tell Quilt to ingest a specific directory, it scans for `.md` files and brings them in as Materials. From there, they get registered and made available for processing.

## What Counts as a Material?

Materials are:

- Markdown files (currently the only supported type)
- Stored in a folder you've chosen
- Used as the source of truth â€” Quilt doesn't change them
- Structured or unstructured â€” both are fine

### Examples

```rust
use quilt::{Material, MaterialStatus};

// Create a new material
let material = Material::new("notes/project-overview.md".to_string());
assert_eq!(material.status, MaterialStatus::Discovered);

// Material starts in Discovered state
assert_eq!(material.status, MaterialStatus::Discovered);
assert!(material.error.is_none());

// Material can be validated
let mut validated = material;
validated.status = MaterialStatus::Valid;
assert_eq!(validated.status, MaterialStatus::Valid);

// Or marked as invalid with an error
let mut invalid = material;
invalid.status = MaterialStatus::Invalid;
invalid.error = Some("Missing required sections".to_string());
```

## What Quilt Tracks About Each Material

When Quilt picks up a file, it gathers just enough information to track it reliably:

```rust
pub struct Material {
    /// Unique identifier for the material (CUID)
    pub id: String,
    /// Path to the file on the filesystem
    pub file_path: String,
    /// Type of the material file (currently Markdown)
    pub file_type: MaterialFileType,
    /// Timestamp when the material was first ingested
    pub ingested_at: OffsetDateTime,
    /// Current status of the material
    pub status: MaterialStatus,
    /// Error message if status is Invalid
    pub error: Option<String>,
}
```

## Material Status

Materials can be in one of three states:

```rust
pub enum MaterialStatus {
    /// Material has been discovered but not yet validated
    Discovered,
    /// Material has passed validation
    Valid,
    /// Material failed validation
    Invalid,
}
```

## Event System

The Material Registry emits events when materials change status:

```rust
// Subscribe to material events
registry.on(|event| {
    if let MaterialEvent::StatusChanged { material, old_status, error } = event {
        println!("Material {} changed status:", material.id);
        println!("  From: {:?}", old_status);
        println!("  To: {:?}", material.status);
        if let Some(err) = error {
            println!("  Error: {}", err);
        }
    }
});
```

## Error Handling

Quilt handles various material-related errors gracefully:

```rust
// Duplicate material registration
let duplicate = Material::new("already/registered.md".to_string());
assert!(registry.register(duplicate).is_none());

// Invalid material update
let unknown = Material::new("not/registered.md".to_string());
assert!(registry.update(unknown).is_none());
```

## Implementation Status

- âœ… Basic Material type with status tracking
- âœ… Material Registry with CRUD operations
- âœ… Event system for status changes
- âœ… Error handling for common cases
- ðŸš§ Directory scanning (coming soon)
- ðŸš§ File watching (coming soon)
- ðŸš§ Validation rules (coming soon)

## What Happens When You Add Files

### Quilt Automatically Tries to Ingest New Materials

```gherkin
Scenario: Adding Markdown Files
  Given you provide a directory containing `.md` files
  When Quilt sees those files
  Then it recognizes them as valid Materials
  And adds them to the Material Registry
  So they're ready for downstream processing
```

## Handling Ingestion Issues

Quilt does its best to quietly and reliably pick up your materials â€” but sometimes a file might not be usable right away. It could be in the wrong format, unreadable, or already registered.

To help you stay informed, Quilt is designed to:

- Detect and handle problematic files gracefully
- Keep track of why certain files couldn't be ingested
- Let you see the status and reason for any skipped or failed files

This ensures Quilt remains stable and trustworthy, while giving you visibility and control over your content.

## Feature: Error Handling (User-Facing)

```gherkin
Scenario: File with Unsupported Extension is Encountered
  Given a directory contains a file with an unsupported extension
  When the file is scanned during ingestion
  Then the file should be skipped
  And the user can view a failed processing status with reason "Unsupported file type"

Scenario: Material Fails Validation
  Given a text or markdown file is detected
  When the file fails validation (e.g., unreadable, empty)
  Then the file should not be registered in the Material Registry
  And the user can view a failed processing status with reason "Validation failed"

Scenario: Duplicate Material is Found
  Given a material has already been registered with the same path
  When the ingestion process is run again
  Then the duplicate should be ignored
  And the user can view a status with reason "Already registered"

Scenario: Inaccessible File Path
  Given the directory includes a file with restricted access
  When the ingestion process attempts to read the file
  Then the file should be skipped
  And the user can view a failed processing status with reason "Permission denied"

Scenario: Unexpected IO Error During Ingestion
  Given a file is being read for ingestion
  When an unexpected IO error occurs
  Then the ingestion process should handle the exception gracefully
  And the user can view a failed processing status with reason "I/O error"
```

## Lifecycle of a Material

When you add a file, Quilt:

1. **Discovers it** in your folder
2. **Validates it** (file type, readability, etc.)
3. **Registers it** in the internal Material Registry
4. **Marks it as ready** for deeper processing in the Swatch Pipeline
5. **Keeps track** of changes if the file gets updated later

You'll always have a clear view of what was picked up, what wasn't, and why.
