# Quilt Implementation Plan

This document outlines the incremental implementation plan for Quilt's core architecture, following a feature-first approach with clear milestones.

## Milestone 1: Core Material Processing Pipeline

**Goal:** Implement the basic three-stage processing pipeline with a functional in-memory repository.

1. Set up the Material Repository

   - Implement thread-safe in-memory store using `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<...>>>`
   - Create material state tracking (Discovered, Cut, Swatched)
   - Add basic CRUD operations with idempotence checks

2. Implement basic Material and Swatch data structures

   - Define Material struct with metadata and content
   - Define Swatch struct for document fragments
   - Implement state transitions and validation

3. Create the Message Channel System

   - Define MaterialMessage enum (Discovered, Cut, Swatched, Error, Shutdown)
   - Set up Tokio mpsc channels with appropriate capacity (100)
   - Implement channel creation and connection between stages

4. Implement minimal actor framework
   - Create Discovery, Cutting, and Labeling workers as Tokio tasks
   - Implement message handling loops for each actor
   - Add graceful shutdown mechanism

**Learning Outcome:** Validate the actor model architecture with direct messaging and verify state management with the repository.

## Milestone 2: Basic File Monitoring and Processing

**Goal:** Process real documents from a watched directory with persistent storage of swatches.

1. Enhance Discovery Worker

   - Implement proper file system watching with debouncing
   - Add support for multiple file types/extensions
   - Implement file content extraction

2. Improve Cutting Worker

   - Implement intelligent document splitting strategies
   - Add metadata extraction from documents
   - Optimize swatch size and overlap

3. Implement Basic Storage

   - Add persistence layer for swatches and materials
   - Implement simple recovery on startup
   - Create basic querying capability

4. Add Error Handling and Logging
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Add structured logging across all components
   - Create recovery mechanisms for failed processing

**Learning Outcome:** Understand real-world file processing patterns and refine the cutting strategies based on actual documents.

## Milestone 3: Embedding and Semantic Search

**Goal:** Implement actual embedding and enable semantic search of swatches.

1. Integrate Embedding Model

   - Add support for local embedding models
   - Implement efficient batching of embedding requests
   - Add caching of embeddings

2. Implement Vector Store

   - Create or integrate a vector database
   - Implement efficient similarity search
   - Add persistence for embeddings

3. Create Basic Query Interface

   - Implement query parsing
   - Create relevance ranking
   - Add basic result formatting

4. Create Spread Generation
   - Implement the assembly of relevant swatches into a spread
   - Add source material reference resolution
   - Create formatting options for different use cases

**Learning Outcome:** Evaluate embedding quality and performance, understand vector search requirements for our use case.

## Milestone 4: Concurrency and Scaling

**Goal:** Optimize the system for concurrent processing and handle larger document sets.

1. Implement Worker Pools

   - Add support for multiple workers per stage
   - Implement work distribution strategies
   - Add worker health monitoring

2. Optimize Repository for Concurrency

   - Refine locking strategies for better throughput
   - Implement more granular locks
   - Add performance metrics collection

3. Implement Backpressure Mechanisms

   - Implement adaptive rate limiting
   - Create monitoring for queue depths

4. Add Resource Management
   - Implement resource usage monitoring
   - Add adaptive worker scaling based on load
   - Create shutdown and cleanup procedures

**Learning Outcome:** Understand scaling characteristics and bottlenecks in the system.

## Milestone 5: User Experience and Integration

**Goal:** Create a usable end-to-end experience with simple user interfaces.

1. Implement CLI Interface

   - Create commands for managing the system
   - Add query interface via CLI
   - Implement configuration options

2. Create Simple Web UI

   - Add basic dashboard for system status
   - Implement search interface
   - Create visualization for swatch connections

3. Add Integration APIs

   - Add webhooks for processing events
   - Create subscription mechanism for updates

4. Implement User Configuration
   - Add customizable watch directories
   - Create pluggable processing pipeline
   - Implement user preferences

**Learning Outcome:** Gather user feedback on the overall experience and identify key improvement areas.

## Milestone 6: Production Readiness

**Goal:** Prepare the system for production use with stability and security features.

1. Implement Comprehensive Testing

   - Add unit tests for all components
   - Create integration test suite
   - Implement performance benchmarks

2. Add Security Features

   - Implement access controls for APIs
   - Add encryption for sensitive data
   - Create security audit logging
