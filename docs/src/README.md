**Quilt** is a local-first, modular memory and context engine. It watches your work, fragments your documents into meaningful pieces (swatches), embeds them into a searchable memory (the swatch book), and assembles contextual spreads in response to queries.

Use Quilt to power LLM tools with fast, structured, and evolving context—without relying on cloud infrastructure or leaking your knowledge.

## ✨ Core Principles

- **Local-first** – Everything runs on your machine. No cloud, no leaks.
- **Modular** – Watching, swatching, embedding, and querying are decoupled and swappable.
- **Quiet** – You don't interact with Quilt directly—it works behind the scenes to support other systems.
- **Crafted** – Inspired by the precision, care, and reuse of quilting.

## 🧠 Domain Concepts

| Term            | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Material**    | A raw document or file—notes, code, transcripts, etc.                                       |
| **Swatch**      | A meaningful fragment cut from a Material                                                   |
| **Swatch Book** | The searchable memory of embedded Swatches                                                  |
| **Spread**      | A contextual bundle of Swatches and their source Material, assembled in response to a Query |

## 🎯 Project Goals

1.  **Powerful Local Context**: Provide rich context to LLM tools without relying on cloud infrastructure.
2.  **Privacy Preservation**: Keep all user data and processing strictly local.
3.  **Flexibility**: Create an adaptable system for different use cases and data types.
4.  **Efficiency**: Process documents incrementally and respond to queries quickly.
5.  **Quality Implementation**: Deliver a robust, production-ready engine following Rust best practices.

## 🧰 What Quilt Does

- 📂 Watches one or more folders for new or updated Materials
- ✂️ Cuts Materials into Swatches based on content structure
- 🔢 Embeds Swatches using a local model (e.g. `llama.cpp`, `gguf`)
- 📚 Stores them in a fast, local Swatch Book
- 🧠 Responds to Queries by assembling contextual Spreads
