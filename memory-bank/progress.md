# Progress

## Project Status

The project is in the **implementation stage**, transitioning from Milestone 5 to Milestone 6. The Cutting Actor has been successfully implemented and integrated with the event system, subscribed to MaterialDiscovered events. The focus is now on implementing the actual document processing functionality in the Cutting Actor.

## What Works

1. **Core Architecture**:

   - QuiltOrchestrator coordinates actor lifecycle and communication
   - Actor model implemented with Actix and proper message types
   - Thread-safe Material Registry with state management and event publishing
   - Event-driven communication between components

2. **Discovery System**:

   - DirectoryScanner scans directories for materials
   - DiscoveryActor manages discovery lifecycle
   - Command-line parameter handling for directory, exclusions
   - Material registration with event publishing

3. **Message System**:

   - Actor-specific message types for direct communication
   - Clear separation of concerns with dedicated message types per actor
   - Strongly typed message responses with proper error handling
   - Actix mailbox system for message queuing and backpressure

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**:

   - Event Bus implemented using Tokio broadcast channels
   - Material Registry coordinating state and events
   - Event types defined for system communication
   - Event monitoring in QuiltOrchestrator
   - Proper log levels for events (debug for routine events)
   - Comprehensive test coverage for event publishing and subscription

5. **Cutting System**:

   - CuttingActor subscribes to MaterialDiscovered events
   - Processing error events for materials not found
   - Actor lifecycle management with proper logging
   - Integration with MaterialRegistry for material lookup
   - Comprehensive test coverage for success and error paths

6. **Supporting Infrastructure**:
   - Structured logging with severity levels and actor details
   - Comprehensive error types for each component
   - Command-line interface with flexible configurations
   - Robust test coverage across components
   - Improved error handling for event-related operations

## In Progress

1. **Material Processing Implementation**:

   - Designing document cutting strategies
   - Planning content splitting algorithms
   - Implementing text extraction
   - Creating cut creation logic

2. **Processing Pipeline Setup**:
   - Defining the material processing workflow
   - Planning the state transition workflow
   - Designing the Cut data structure
   - Preparing for CutsRepository implementation

## Next Major Milestone

**Milestone 6: "Cutting Actor Processes Materials"** - The current focus is on implementing actual document processing in the Cutting Actor.

## Upcoming Work

1. **Document Cutting Functionality** (Milestone 6):

   - Implement text extraction and processing logic
   - Create document splitting strategies
   - Add cut creation from materials
   - Keep detailed metrics of processing

2. **Cut Event Publishing** (Milestone 6):

   - Add MaterialCut event publishing
   - Create proper state transitions in Registry
   - Add validation through logging
   - Implement recovery for failed cuts

3. **Cuts Repository Implementation** (Milestone 7):

   - Create in-memory storage for cuts
   - Implement CRUD operations
   - Add integration with Registry
   - Create comprehensive tests

4. **Recent Improvements**:
   - Implemented CuttingActor with event subscription
   - Added processing error events for error cases
   - Created comprehensive test coverage for Cutting Actor
   - Added integration with QuiltOrchestrator
   - Improved error handling with detailed error messages
