# Progress

## Project Status

The project is in the **early implementation stage**, transitioning from Milestone 2 to Milestone 3. The foundation architecture has been established with the actor framework, material repository, and discovery system.

## What Works

1. **Core Architecture**:

   - QuiltOrchestrator coordinates actor lifecycle and communication
   - Actor model implemented with Actix and proper message types
   - Thread-safe Material Repository with state management
   - Channel-based message system using Tokio mpsc channels

2. **Discovery System**:

   - DirectoryScanner scans directories for materials
   - DiscoveryActor manages discovery lifecycle
   - Command-line parameter handling for directory, exclusions
   - Basic material registration workflow

3. **Message System**:

   - Actor-specific message types for direct communication
   - Clear separation of concerns with dedicated message types per actor
   - Strongly typed message responses with proper error handling
   - Actix mailbox system for message queuing and backpressure

4. **Supporting Infrastructure**:
   - Structured logging with severity levels and actor details
   - Comprehensive error types for each component
   - Command-line interface with flexible configurations
   - Robust test coverage across components

## In Progress

1. **Actor Communication**:

   - Implementing direct actor-to-actor message passing
   - Creating appropriate message types for DiscoveryActor and CuttingActor
   - Setting up actor supervision in the orchestrator

2. **CuttingActor Design**:
   - Planning implementation of material processing
   - Designing document content extraction strategy
   - Defining appropriate cutting algorithms

## Next Major Milestone

**Milestone 3: "Discovery Actor Sends Material Messages"** - The current focus is establishing message passing between actors for pipeline processing.

## Upcoming Work

1. **Core Pipeline** (Milestones 3-5):

   - Complete message passing from Discovery to Cutting
   - Implement CuttingActor for material processing
   - Create CutsRepository for storing processed fragments
   - Add Labeling stage for final processing

2. **Embedding and Search** (Milestones 6-9):

   - Integrate local embedding models
   - Implement vector storage
   - Create query interface

3. **Production Readiness** (Milestone 10):
   - Add persistence for repositories
   - Implement startup/shutdown persistence
   - Create consistency checks and error recovery
