# Progress

## Project Status

The project is in the **early implementation stage** (Milestone 1: Core Material Processing Pipeline). We're establishing the foundational architecture and implementing the core components.

## What Works

1. **Project Setup**:

   - Basic project structure created
   - Documentation system established with mdBook
   - Initial codebase organized
   - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions configured
   - Code quality tools (rustfmt, Clippy) setup complete
   - Development documentation created

2. **Architecture Design**:

   - Actor model architecture defined
   - Component responsibilities documented
   - Message flow established

3. **Initial Documentation**:

   - Core domain concepts documented
   - Architecture diagrams created
   - Implementation plan outlined
   - Developer guide with testing standards
   - CI/CD process documented

4. **Material Repository**:

   - Implemented thread-safe in-memory store using `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<...>>>`
   - Created material state tracking with validation (Discovered, Cut, Swatched, Error)
   - Added CRUD operations with proper state transition validation
   - Completed test coverage for all repository functionality
   - Integrated with Tokio's async runtime for better compatibility with the actor model
   - Added Default implementation for MaterialRepository

5. **Material Data Structure**:

   - ✅ Implemented Material struct with necessary metadata
   - ✅ Created state transition logic and validation
   - ✅ Added basic Material creation and manipulation functionality

6. **Message Channel System**:

   - ✅ Defined MaterialMessage enum with five variants (Discovered, Cut, Swatched, Error, Shutdown)
   - ✅ Implemented channel system with fixed capacity (100 messages) for natural backpressure
   - ✅ Created helper traits for message handling and error management
   - ✅ Added comprehensive tests including pipeline message flow
   - ✅ Documented the architecture and usage patterns
   - ✅ Optimized message passing by using IDs instead of full objects when appropriate

7. **Testing and Quality Infrastructure**:
   - ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for PR validation
   - ✅ rustfmt configuration for consistent code style
   - ✅ Clippy configuration with custom rules
   - ✅ Unit tests for core components
   - ✅ Integration tests for system behavior
   - ✅ Test helpers and utilities
   - ✅ Code quality documentation

## What's In Progress

1. **Worker Implementation**:
   - Starting with the Discovery Worker
   - Planning the Cutting Worker logic
   - Designing the worker message handling loops

## What's Left to Build

1. **Core Pipeline** (Milestone 1):

   - Implement the three worker types (Discovery, Cutting, Labeling)
   - Create message handling loops
   - Add graceful shutdown mechanism

2. **File Monitoring** (Milestone 2):

   - Implement file system watching
   - Add document content extraction
   - Create intelligent document splitting
   - Build basic persistence

3. **Embedding and Search** (Milestone 3):

   - Integrate local embedding models
   - Implement vector storage
   - Create query interface
   - Build spread assembly

4. **Additional Milestones**:
   - Concurrency and scaling
   - User experience and integration
   - Production readiness

## Known Issues and Challenges

1. **Implementation Challenges**:

   - Ensuring thread safety in workers when sharing repository access
   - Handling potential race conditions in message processing
   - Managing resource usage for embedding operations

2. **Design Questions**:

   - Optimal strategy for document fragmentation
   - Best approach for vector similarity search
   - Efficient persistence mechanism

3. **Technical Debt**:
   - Need to establish comprehensive integration testing approach
   - Documentation needs to be kept in sync with implementation
   - Swatch data structure implementation deferred to later milestone

## Next Major Milestone

**Milestone 2: Basic File Monitoring and Processing** is targeted after completion of the core pipeline, estimated to begin in 3-4 weeks.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Language**: Rust (stable channel)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio
- **Documentation**: mdBook with admonish extension

## Implementation Details

### Testing Approach

- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive tests for each component's behavior
- **Integration Testing**: Tests for how components work together (e.g., message flow through channels)
- **Async Testing**: Using Tokio's test utilities for async code
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automatic PR validation
- **Code Quality Tools**:
  - rustfmt with custom configuration for code style
  - Clippy with tailored rules for static analysis
  - Documented standards in the development guide
- **Test Organization**:
  - Unit tests located alongside the code they test
  - Integration tests in dedicated test modules
  - Test utilities to simplify test creation
