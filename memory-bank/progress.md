# Progress

## Project Status

The project is in the **implementation stage**. Milestone 9: "Define Swatch Structures & Repository Trait" has been completed, adding the `Swatch` struct and `SwatchRepository` trait to support the embedding functionality. The next step is Milestone 10: "Implement SQLite Swatch Repository."

## Current Status

- **Architecture:** Defined and documented in `@actor-model-architecture.md`, incorporating event-driven actors, a shared event bus, a central registry, internal backpressure queues for processing actors, and a reconciliation actor for resilience.
- **Foundation:** Core repository, data structures, message channels, and basic actor framework are complete (Milestones 1-4).
- **Discovery:** `DiscoveryActor` implemented and successfully publishing `MaterialDiscovered` events to the shared `EventBus` (Milestone 4).
- **Cutting Actor (M5):** `CuttingActor` skeleton created, subscribing to events, and implementing the internal listener/mpsc/processor pattern (Milestone 5).
- **Cutting Logic (M6):** Completed. Integrated `text-splitter`, implemented processing logic within the `CuttingActor`'s processor task, and updated `MaterialRegistry` to handle state updates (`Discovered` -> `Cut`/`Error`) and publish corresponding events (`MaterialCut`/`ProcessingError`).
- **Cuts Repository (M7):** Completed. Implemented the full `Cut` data structure, `CutsRepository` interface with thread-safe in-memory implementation, and integration with the `CuttingActor`. The repository provides comprehensive CRUD operations, efficient indexing, and is fully connected to the processing pipeline.
- **Repository Refactoring (M7.5):** Completed. Transformed repositories to use the trait-based pattern. Successfully renamed `struct MaterialRepository` to `struct InMemoryMaterialRepository`, introduced `trait MaterialRepository` and `trait CutsRepository`, and updated all dependent code.
- **SQLite Repository (M7.5):** Fully completed. Implemented both `SqliteMaterialRepository` and `SqliteCutsRepository` using SQLx, with in-memory database support. Added command-line option to select between SQLite and in-memory repositories.
- **Swatching Actor (M8):** Completed. Implemented `SwatchingActor` that subscribes to `MaterialCut` events and follows the same internal listener/mpsc/processor pattern used in the `CuttingActor` for backpressure handling. The actor is fully integrated with the `QuiltOrchestrator`. **Does not yet process cuts.**
- **Reconciliation:** Actor design included in architecture, implementation planned (Milestone 13).

## What Works

- Actor system initialization and basic message handling.
- Directory scanning and material discovery via `DiscoveryActor`.
- Event Bus setup (`broadcast`) and event publishing/subscription.
- Material Repository trait support with two implementations:
  - `InMemoryMaterialRepository` using `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<...>>>` for in-memory storage
  - `SqliteMaterialRepository` using `sqlx` with SQLite for persistent storage
- Material Registry coordinating state management and event publishing (`MaterialDiscovered`, `MaterialCut`, `ProcessingError`).
- `CuttingActor` with internal listener/mpsc/processor pattern for backpressure.
- Text cutting using `text-splitter` within `CuttingActor`.
- Material status transition `Discovered` -> `Cut` or `Discovered` -> `Error` handled by `CuttingActor` via `MaterialRegistry`.
- Event publication (`MaterialCut`, `ProcessingError`) handled by `MaterialRegistry`.
- `Cut` data structure with complete metadata (id, material_id, chunk_index, content, token_count, byte offsets).
- `CutsRepository` with two implementations:
  - `InMemoryCutsRepository` for in-memory storage
  - `SqliteCutsRepository` for SQLite-backed persistent storage
- Full integration of the cutting pipeline from discovery to storage (Material discovery → Cutting → Repository storage).
- Comprehensive error handling throughout the cutting pipeline.
- Repository trait pattern implementation allowing easy swapping between storage backends.
- Command-line option (`--in-memory`) for selecting repository type.
- Event bus reliably transmits events (`MaterialDiscovered`, `MaterialCut`, `ProcessingError`).
- `CuttingActor` subscribes to `MaterialDiscovered`, processes files using `TextCutter`, and stores cuts in the repository.
- `CuttingActor` correctly reads file content using absolute paths resolved by the `DiscoveryActor`.
- `MaterialRegistry` handles state transitions (`Discovered` -> `Cut`, `Discovered` -> `Error`) and publishes corresponding events.
- SQLite integration works for both the `MaterialRepository` and `CutsRepository`, selectable via command-line flag.
- `Material` timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `status_updated_at`) are correctly managed and stored in both repository implementations.
- Foreign key constraints between materials and cuts tables ensure data integrity.
- `SwatchingActor` subscribes to `MaterialCut` events and logs receipt.
- Event flow from `CuttingActor` through EventBus to `SwatchingActor` is established and functional. SwatchingActor logs event receipt.
