# Progress

## Project Status

The project is in the **implementation stage**, transitioning from Milestone 4 to Milestone 5. The event-driven architecture is now complete with the Discovery Actor fully integrated with the Material Registry and event system. The focus is now on implementing the Cutting Actor to process discovered materials.

## What Works

1. **Core Architecture**:

   - QuiltOrchestrator coordinates actor lifecycle and communication
   - Actor model implemented with Actix and proper message types
   - Thread-safe Material Registry with state management and event publishing
   - Event-driven communication between components

2. **Discovery System**:

   - DirectoryScanner scans directories for materials
   - DiscoveryActor manages discovery lifecycle
   - Command-line parameter handling for directory, exclusions
   - Material registration with event publishing

3. **Message System**:

   - Actor-specific message types for direct communication
   - Clear separation of concerns with dedicated message types per actor
   - Strongly typed message responses with proper error handling
   - Actix mailbox system for message queuing and backpressure

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**:

   - Event Bus implemented using Tokio broadcast channels
   - Material Registry coordinating state and events
   - Event types defined for system communication
   - Event monitoring in QuiltOrchestrator
   - Proper log levels for events (debug for routine events)
   - Comprehensive test coverage for event publishing and subscription

5. **Supporting Infrastructure**:
   - Structured logging with severity levels and actor details
   - Comprehensive error types for each component
   - Command-line interface with flexible configurations
   - Robust test coverage across components
   - Improved error handling for event-related operations

## In Progress

1. **Cutting Actor Development**:

   - Designing Cutting Actor that subscribes to MaterialDiscovered events
   - Planning document processing strategies
   - Implementing basic event handling before processing logic
   - Creating actor monitoring infrastructure

2. **Processing Pipeline Setup**:
   - Defining the material processing workflow
   - Planning the state transition workflow
   - Designing the Cut data structure
   - Preparing for CutsRepository implementation

## Next Major Milestone

**Milestone 5: "Basic Cutting Actor Creation"** - The current focus is creating a minimal Cutting Actor that listens for MaterialDiscovered events.

## Upcoming Work

1. **Cutting Actor Skeleton** (Milestone 5):

   - Create Cutting Actor with event subscription
   - Implement actor lifecycle (start/stop)
   - Set up event monitoring for the actor
   - Add metrics and health checks

2. **Processing Pipeline** (Milestones 6-7):

   - Implement document cutting functionality
   - Create state transitions for cut materials
   - Develop repository for cuts
   - Implement MaterialCut event publishing

3. **Pipeline Completion** (Milestones 8-10):

   - Create Swatching Actor with event subscription
   - Complete event flow through all actors
   - Implement query capabilities
   - Add persistence and recovery mechanisms

4. **Recent Improvements**:
   - Improved error message extraction in debug logging
   - Changed event monitoring log level from info to debug for better production usage
   - Simplified test code for better readability and maintainability
   - Fully transitioned from direct Repository use to Registry pattern
