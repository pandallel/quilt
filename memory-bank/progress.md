# Progress

## Project Status

The project is in the **early implementation stage** (Milestone 1: Core Material Processing Pipeline). We're establishing the foundational architecture and beginning to implement the core components.

## What Works

1. **Project Setup**:

   - Basic project structure created
   - Documentation system established with mdBook
   - Initial codebase organized

2. **Architecture Design**:

   - Actor model architecture defined
   - Component responsibilities documented
   - Message flow established

3. **Initial Documentation**:
   - Core domain concepts documented
   - Architecture diagrams created
   - Implementation plan outlined

## What's In Progress

1. **Material Repository**:

   - Beginning implementation of thread-safe storage
   - Defining material state transitions

2. **Message System**:

   - Creating the message types and channels
   - Setting up the basic communication flow

3. **Worker Implementation**:
   - Starting with the Discovery Worker
   - Planning the Cutting Worker implementation

## What's Left to Build

1. **Core Pipeline** (Milestone 1):

   - Complete all three worker implementations
   - Implement message passing
   - Create state management in the repository
   - Add basic testing

2. **File Monitoring** (Milestone 2):

   - Implement file system watching
   - Add document content extraction
   - Create intelligent document splitting
   - Build basic persistence

3. **Embedding and Search** (Milestone 3):

   - Integrate local embedding models
   - Implement vector storage
   - Create query interface
   - Build spread assembly

4. **Additional Milestones**:
   - Concurrency and scaling
   - User experience and integration
   - Production readiness

## Known Issues and Challenges

1. **Implementation Challenges**:

   - Ensuring thread safety in the repository
   - Handling potential race conditions in message processing
   - Managing resource usage for embedding operations

2. **Design Questions**:

   - Optimal strategy for document fragmentation
   - Best approach for vector similarity search
   - Efficient persistence mechanism

3. **Technical Debt**:
   - Need to establish comprehensive testing approach
   - Documentation needs to be kept in sync with implementation

## Next Major Milestone

**Milestone 2: Basic File Monitoring and Processing** is targeted after completion of the core pipeline, estimated to begin in 3-4 weeks.
