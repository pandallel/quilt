# Progress

## Project Status

The project is in the **implementation stage**, working on Milestone 6: "Material Text Cutting Implementation". The TextCutter component has been successfully implemented using the text-splitter crate, and work is in progress on integrating it fully with the CuttingActor for document processing.

## What Works

1. **Core Architecture**:

   - QuiltOrchestrator coordinates actor lifecycle and communication
   - Actor model implemented with Actix and proper message types
   - Thread-safe Material Registry with state management and event publishing
   - Event-driven communication between components

2. **Discovery System**:

   - DirectoryScanner scans directories for materials
   - DiscoveryActor manages discovery lifecycle
   - Command-line parameter handling for directory, exclusions
   - Material registration with event publishing

3. **Message System**:

   - Actor-specific message types for direct communication
   - Clear separation of concerns with dedicated message types per actor
   - Strongly typed message responses with proper error handling
   - Actix mailbox system for message queuing and backpressure

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**:

   - Event Bus implemented using Tokio broadcast channels
   - Material Registry coordinating state and events
   - Event types defined for system communication
   - Event monitoring in QuiltOrchestrator
   - Proper log levels for events (debug for routine events)
   - Comprehensive test coverage for event publishing and subscription

5. **Cutting System**:

   - CuttingActor subscribes to MaterialDiscovered events
   - TextCutter implemented with text-splitter for semantic chunking
   - CutterConfig with configurable token size parameters (target: 300, min: 150, max: 800)
   - ChunkInfo data structure for tracking cut chunks
   - Asynchronous file content extraction with tokio::fs
   - Processing error events for handling failures
   - Comprehensive test coverage for cutting functionality

6. **Supporting Infrastructure**:
   - Structured logging with severity levels and actor details
   - Comprehensive error types for each component
   - Command-line interface with flexible configurations
   - Robust test coverage across components
   - Improved error handling for event-related operations

## In Progress

1. **Material Cut Processing**:

   - Finalizing document cutting implementation
   - Completing MaterialCut event creation and publishing
   - Implementing material state transition (Discovered â†’ Cut)
   - Adding error recovery for failed cuts
   - Creating metrics for cut creation and processing

2. **Processing Pipeline Enhancement**:

   - Implementing backpressure mechanism for large file batches
   - Creating controlled processing rate with work queuing
   - Planning the Cuts Repository implementation
   - Preparing for integration with the next pipeline stage

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Addressing timeout issues in CuttingActor for large file batches
   - Implementing throttling mechanism for event processing
   - Optimizing memory usage during batch processing
   - Adding monitoring for processing rates and queue depths

## Next Major Milestone

**Milestone 7: "Cuts Repository Implementation"** - After completing Milestone 6, the focus will be on implementing storage for processed cuts.

## Upcoming Work

1. **Complete Cutting Implementation** (Milestone 6):

   - Finish MaterialCut event publishing
   - Complete state transitions in Registry
   - Add validation through logging
   - Implement recovery for failed cuts

2. **Cuts Repository Implementation** (Milestone 7):

   - Create in-memory storage for cuts
   - Implement CRUD operations
   - Add integration with Registry
   - Create comprehensive tests

3. **Performance Improvements** (Milestone 6-7):

   - Implement backpressure mechanism in CuttingActor
   - Add rate limiting for processing events
   - Create circuit breaker for system overload protection
   - Optimize memory usage during batch processing

4. **Swatching Actor Implementation** (Milestone 8):

   - Create basic Swatching Actor skeleton
   - Implement event subscription for MaterialCut events
   - Add actor lifecycle management
   - Set up event flow monitoring

5. **Recent Improvements**:
   - Implemented TextCutter with text-splitter crate integration
   - Added CutterConfig for configurable token sizes
   - Created ChunkInfo model for tracking cut chunks
   - Enhanced CuttingActor with file content extraction
   - Added specialized error types for cutting operations
   - Enabled tokio::fs for asynchronous file operations
