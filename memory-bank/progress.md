# Progress

## Project Status

The project is in the **early implementation stage** (Milestone 2: Discovery Actor Uses Scanner). We've established the foundational architecture, implemented the core components, and successfully integrated the DirectoryScanner with the DiscoveryActor.

## What Works

1. **Project Setup**:

   - Basic project structure created
   - Documentation system established with mdBook
   - Initial codebase organized
   - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions configured
   - Code quality tools (rustfmt, Clippy) setup complete
   - Development documentation created

2. **Architecture Design**:

   - Actor model architecture defined
   - Component responsibilities documented
   - Message flow established

3. **Initial Documentation**:

   - Core domain concepts documented
   - Architecture diagrams created
   - Implementation plan outlined
   - Developer guide with testing standards
   - CI/CD process documented

4. **Material Repository**:

   - Implemented thread-safe in-memory store using `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<...>>>`
   - Created material state tracking with validation (Discovered, Cut, Swatched, Error)
   - Added CRUD operations with proper state transition validation
   - Completed test coverage for all repository functionality
   - Integrated with Tokio's async runtime for better compatibility with the actor model
   - Added Default implementation for MaterialRepository

5. **Material Data Structure**:

   - ✅ Implemented Material struct with necessary metadata
   - ✅ Created state transition logic and validation
   - ✅ Added basic Material creation and manipulation functionality

6. **Message Channel System**:

   - ✅ Defined MaterialMessage enum with five variants (Discovered, Cut, Swatched, Error, Shutdown)
   - ✅ Implemented channel system with fixed capacity (100 messages) for natural backpressure
   - ✅ Created helper traits for message handling and error management
   - ✅ Added comprehensive tests including pipeline message flow
   - ✅ Documented the architecture and usage patterns
   - ✅ Optimized message passing by using IDs instead of full objects when appropriate

7. **Actor System**:

   - ✅ Added Actix integration for actor framework
   - ✅ Created base actor module with common message types
   - ✅ Implemented DiscoveryActor with proper lifecycle management
   - ✅ Added structured logging with env_logger
   - ✅ Set up proper Actix/Tokio runtime integration
   - ✅ Created modular actor organization with dedicated namespaces
   - ✅ Implemented QuiltOrchestrator for centralized actor management
   - ✅ Refactored main.rs to use QuiltOrchestrator with proper separation of concerns
   - ✅ Fixed actix runtime usage with #[actix::main] instead of actix_rt

8. **Discovery System**:

   - ✅ Created DiscoveryConfig for scanner configuration
   - ✅ Integrated DirectoryScanner with DiscoveryActor
   - ✅ Implemented command-line argument parsing for discovery configuration
   - ✅ Added material registration from discovered files
   - ✅ Enhanced logging with repository statistics
   - ✅ Added test coverage for discovery functionality

9. **Testing and Quality Infrastructure**:
   - ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for PR validation
   - ✅ rustfmt configuration for consistent code style
   - ✅ Clippy configuration with custom rules
   - ✅ Unit tests for core components
   - ✅ Integration tests for system behavior
   - ✅ Test helpers and utilities
   - ✅ Code quality documentation

## What's In Progress

1. **CuttingActor Implementation**:

   - Initial implementation of the CuttingActor
   - Adding document content extraction
   - Creating basic document splitting strategies

2. **Message Channel Integration**:
   - Connecting DiscoveryActor to CuttingActor via channels
   - Implementing message transformation
   - Adding proper error handling with backpressure

## What's Left to Build

1. **Core Pipeline** (Milestone 3-4):

   - Implement the remaining worker types (Cutting, Labeling)
   - Create message handling loops
   - Add graceful shutdown mechanism

2. **File Monitoring** (Milestone 5):

   - Implement file system watching
   - Add document content extraction
   - Create intelligent document splitting
   - Build basic persistence

3. **Embedding and Search** (Milestone 6-7):

   - Integrate local embedding models
   - Implement vector storage
   - Create query interface
   - Build spread assembly

4. **Additional Milestones**:
   - Concurrency and scaling
   - User experience and integration
   - Production readiness

## Known Issues and Challenges

1. **Implementation Challenges**:

   - Ensuring thread safety in workers when sharing repository access
   - Handling potential race conditions in message processing
   - Managing resource usage for embedding operations

2. **Design Questions**:

   - Optimal strategy for document fragmentation
   - Best approach for vector similarity search
   - Efficient persistence mechanism

3. **Technical Debt**:
   - Need to establish comprehensive integration testing approach
   - Documentation needs to be kept in sync with implementation
   - Swatch data structure implementation deferred to later milestone

## Next Major Milestone

**Milestone 3: "Discovery Actor Sends Material Messages"** is our next focus, which will establish message passing between actors in the pipeline.
