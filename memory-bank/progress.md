# Progress

## Project Status

The project is in the **early implementation stage**, transitioning from Milestone 2 to Milestone 3. The foundation architecture has been established with the actor framework, material repository, and discovery system. The architecture has been refined to follow an event-driven approach with a Material Registry.

## What Works

1. **Core Architecture**:

   - QuiltOrchestrator coordinates actor lifecycle and communication
   - Actor model implemented with Actix and proper message types
   - Thread-safe Material Repository with state management
   - Basic message types for actor communication

2. **Discovery System**:

   - DirectoryScanner scans directories for materials
   - DiscoveryActor manages discovery lifecycle
   - Command-line parameter handling for directory, exclusions
   - Basic material registration workflow

3. **Message System**:

   - Actor-specific message types for direct communication
   - Clear separation of concerns with dedicated message types per actor
   - Strongly typed message responses with proper error handling
   - Actix mailbox system for message queuing and backpressure

4. **Supporting Infrastructure**:
   - Structured logging with severity levels and actor details
   - Comprehensive error types for each component
   - Command-line interface with flexible configurations
   - Robust test coverage across components

## In Progress

1. **Event-Driven Architecture Implementation**:

   - Developing Event Bus using Tokio broadcast channels
   - Creating Material Registry to coordinate state and events
   - Designing event types for system communication
   - Planning actor subscription to events

2. **Repository Refinement**:
   - Separating state management (Registry) from persistence (Repository)
   - Ensuring atomic operations for state changes and event publishing
   - Implementing thread-safe event distribution

## Next Major Milestone

**Milestone 3: "Event Bus and Material Registry Foundation"** - The current focus is establishing the core communication infrastructure for the event-driven architecture.

## Upcoming Work

1. **Event-Driven Implementation** (Milestones 3-4):

   - Implement Event Bus with Tokio broadcast channels
   - Create Material Registry as coordinator
   - Update Discovery Actor to publish events
   - Add event monitoring and metrics

2. **Processing Pipeline** (Milestones 5-7):

   - Create Cutting Actor with event subscription
   - Implement document cutting functionality
   - Create Swatching Actor with event subscription
   - Develop repositories for cuts and swatches

3. **Pipeline Completion** (Milestones 8-10):

   - Complete event flow through all actors
   - Implement query capabilities
   - Add persistence and recovery mechanisms
   - Validate the end-to-end pipeline

4. **Open Questions to Address**:
   - Actor recovery and supervision strategies
   - Event ordering and consistency mechanisms
   - Backpressure handling approaches
   - State recovery after system crashes
   - Performance optimization for large datasets
