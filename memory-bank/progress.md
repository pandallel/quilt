# Progress

## Project Status

The project is in the **implementation stage**, transitioning from Milestone 3 to Milestone 4. The foundation architecture has been established with the actor framework, material repository, discovery system, event bus, and material registry. The architecture follows an event-driven approach with a Material Registry acting as the central coordinator.

## What Works

1. **Core Architecture**:

   - QuiltOrchestrator coordinates actor lifecycle and communication
   - Actor model implemented with Actix and proper message types
   - Thread-safe Material Repository with state management
   - Basic message types for actor communication

2. **Discovery System**:

   - DirectoryScanner scans directories for materials
   - DiscoveryActor manages discovery lifecycle
   - Command-line parameter handling for directory, exclusions
   - Basic material registration workflow

3. **Message System**:

   - Actor-specific message types for direct communication
   - Clear separation of concerns with dedicated message types per actor
   - Strongly typed message responses with proper error handling
   - Actix mailbox system for message queuing and backpressure

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**:

   - Event Bus implemented using Tokio broadcast channels
   - Material Registry coordinating state and events
   - Event types defined for system communication
   - Comprehensive test coverage for event publishing and subscription

5. **Supporting Infrastructure**:
   - Structured logging with severity levels and actor details
   - Comprehensive error types for each component
   - Command-line interface with flexible configurations
   - Robust test coverage across components

## In Progress

1. **Discovery Actor Event Integration**:

   - Updating Discovery Actor to publish events via Material Registry
   - Implementing event monitoring in the main application
   - Adding metrics for event flow
   - Creating testing infrastructure for event validation

2. **Cutting Actor Development**:
   - Designing Cutting Actor that subscribes to MaterialDiscovered events
   - Planning document processing strategies
   - Implementing basic event handling before processing logic

## Next Major Milestone

**Milestone 4: "Discovery Actor Publishes Events"** - The current focus is making the Discovery Actor use the Event Bus for material discovery operations.

## Upcoming Work

1. **Discovery Actor Event Integration** (Milestone 4):

   - Update Discovery Actor to publish events
   - Add event monitoring and metrics
   - Keep existing direct interactions for compatibility
   - Create test harness for validation

2. **Processing Pipeline** (Milestones 5-7):

   - Create Cutting Actor with event subscription
   - Implement document cutting functionality
   - Create Swatching Actor with event subscription
   - Develop repositories for cuts and swatches

3. **Pipeline Completion** (Milestones 8-10):

   - Complete event flow through all actors
   - Implement query capabilities
   - Add persistence and recovery mechanisms
   - Validate the end-to-end pipeline

4. **Open Questions to Address**:
   - Actor recovery and supervision strategies
   - Event ordering and consistency mechanisms
   - Backpressure handling approaches
   - State recovery after system crashes
   - Performance optimization for large datasets
